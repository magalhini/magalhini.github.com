    <p>I'm a Portuguese web developer currently living in Montreal, Canada. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</p>

    <p>
        Currently, I work with the wonderful people at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>
        as a front-end developer. I seriously enjoy doing
        a bit of the many different worlds in development, but front-end is definitely
        where the heart is.
    </p>

    <p>
        I maintain a separate website for my work at <a href="http://www.ricardofilipe.com">ricardofilipe.com</a>.
        Why I have a separate one, I have no idea. It's also incredibly outdated, you've been warned.

    <h4 class="about__title">The blog</h4>

    <p>
        This blog is built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages, and of course you can
        check out its source code. As well as serving as a blogging platform, it's also
        an excuse for me to try different patterns of development on the client side,
        so structure here is very experimental and bound to be changed a lot!
    </p>

    <p>
        The original theme upon this was built was <a href="https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll">Pixyll</a>, of which I stripped pretty much
        all markup and styling, but kept some of the Jekyll functionality as this was my
        first stab with the blogging platform. Big thanks and credits to its author!
